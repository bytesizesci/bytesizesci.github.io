Kristen James is a Ph.D. candidate in the Nutritional Biology Graduate Group at the University of California, Davis. Her dissertation research uses translational approaches in humans and mice to understand the dietary, lifestyle and multi-omic factors that influence blood concentrations of the metabolite trimethylamine n-oxide (TMAO), which is linked to cardiometabolic diseases. 

## Humans
TMAO is elevated in individuals with cardiometabolic diseases, but it is unclear whether the metabolite is a biomarker of concern in healthy individuals. To address this, James and colleagues utilized a cross-sectional trial in unmedicated adults of mixed age and BMI (18-66 years and 18-44 kg/m2) and assessed the relationships among TMAO, diet, the fecal microbiome, and cardiometabolic risk factors.

## Mice
Understanding the genetic regulation of TMAO will reveal dietary, microbial, and therapeutic targets to reduce the metabolite's pathogenicity. To this end, James's research employs complex genetic models such as the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse model to identify genetic variants related to TMAO. The DO is a multiparent advanced genetic inter-cross panel derived from 5 classical inbred and 3 wild-derived inbred mouse strains and is known for its vast phenotypic variability and its utility in high-resolution genetic mapping of complex traits. 

## Research Interests
The broad question that draws Kristen to science is, "what makes you, you and me, me?" Kristen's current research addresses this question by looking at the role of environment (diet) and genetics on health. In the future, she'd like to investigate healthy aging and longevity and wants to identify genetic (genome, trascriptome, metabolome) and environmental factors (diet, exposome, sleep, stress, exercise, etc.) that predispose individuals to chronic diseases. Kristen's favorite part of the research process is data analysis and is skilled at RStudio, the command line, high performance computing clusters and data visualization.

## Hobbies
Kristen's hobbies include exercising (lifting weights, running, hiking, cycling, playing tennis, skiing, and golfing), and making art (watercolor, ink drawings, print making, photography and throwing pottery). Check out her art on Instagram, [@kjsketch](https://www.instagram.com/kjsketch/)).
