Kristen Sutton received her PhD in [Nutritional Biology](https://ggnb.ucdavis.edu) from the University of California, Davis in the lab of [Dr. Brian Bennett](https://www.ars.usda.gov/pacific-west-area/davis-ca/whnrc/omu/people/brian-j-bennett/bennett-lab/). Her PhD research used translational approaches in humans and Diversity Outbred mice to understand the dietary, lifestyle and multi-omic factors that influence plasma concentrations of trimethylamine n-oxide (TMAO), a dietary derived metabolite linked to cardiometabolic diseases. Kristen is currently a Post Doctoral Fellow in the lab of [Dr. Joanne Cole](https://jcolelab.com/) in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/dbmi) and the [Colorado Center for Precision Medicine](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/ccpm) at the [University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/).

## Statistical Genetics


## Humans
TMAO is elevated in individuals with cardiometabolic diseases, but it is unclear whether the metabolite is a biomarker of concern in healthy individuals. To address this, James and colleagues utilized a cross-sectional trial in unmedicated adults of mixed age and BMI (18-66 years and 18-44 kg/m2) and assessed the relationships among TMAO, diet, the fecal microbiome, and cardiometabolic risk factors including clinical chemistry biomarkers and markers of endothelial function. The findings are published in an open-access journal and can be read here, [https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14071376](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14071376). 

## Mice
Understanding the genetic regulation of TMAO will reveal dietary, microbial, and therapeutic targets to reduce the metabolite's pathogenicity. To this end, James utilized the heterogeneous [Diversity Outbred (DO)](https://www.jax.org/strain/009376) mouse model to examine the effects of sex and diet on the genetic regulation of plasma TMAO concentrations. Using quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, she not only identified a 0.5 Mbp locus regulating TMAO concentrations, she also identified a novel gene by diet interaction emphasizing that genes regulating metabolites in one diet environment may play minor roles in different diet environments. James then completed a meta-analysis in over 1,500 DO mice and replicated the QTL regulating TMAO. The manuscript reporting these results is in preparation.

## Research Interests
The broad question that draws Kristen to scientific research is, "what makes you, you and me, me?" Kristen's current research addresses this question by looking at the role of the environment (via diet) and genetics on biomarkers of health. In the future, Kristen can envision herself leading a team of researchers contributing to the precision health field by investigating healthy aging/longevity and identifying genetic (i.e. genome, trascriptome, metabolome) and environmental factors (i.e. diet, exposome, sleep, stress, exercise) that affect disease progression. Kristen's favorite part of the research process is the data analysis. As such, she is fluent in R, and skilled at the command line, using high performance computing clusters and creating data visualizations.

## Hobbies
Kristen's hobbies include exercising (lifting weights, running, hiking, cycling, playing tennis, skiing, and golfing), making art (watercolor, ink drawings, print making, photography and throwing pottery), and spending time with her friends and family.
