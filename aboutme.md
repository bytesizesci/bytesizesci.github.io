My name is Kristen James and I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Nutritional Biology Graduate Group at the University of California, Davis. My dissertation research is focused on the metabolite trimethylamine n-oxide (TMAO), which is derived from the diet and the gut microbiome and is linked to diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. My research uses translational approaches in humans and mice.

## Humans
TMAO is elevated in individuals with cardiometabolic diseases, but it is unclear whether the metabolite is a biomarker of concern in healthy individuals. My research utilizes a cross-sectional study in metabolically healthy adults ages 18-66 years and BMI 18-44 kg/m2 and assessed the relationship between TMAO and diet, the fecal microbiome, and cardiometabolic risk factors.

## Mice
Understanding the genetic regulation of TMAO will reveal dietary, microbial, and/or therapeutic targets to reduce its pathogenicity. To this end, my research employs complex genetic models such as the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse model to identify genetic variants related to TMAO. The DO is multiparent advanced genetic inter-cross panel derived from 5 classical inbred and 3 wild-derived inbred mouse strains and is known for its vast phenotypic variability and its utility in high-resolution genetic mapping of complex traits. 

## Research Interests
The broad question that draws me to science is, "what makes you, you and me, me?" My current research addresses this question by looking at the role of environment (diet) and genetics. In the future, I'd like to investigate healthy aging and longevity and want to identify genetic (genome, trascriptome, metabolome) and environmental factors (diet, exposome, sleep, stress, exercise, etc.) that predispose individuals to cardiometabolic diseases. My favorite part of the research process is data analysis and visualization.

## Hobbies
My hobbies include exercising (lifting weights, running, hiking, cycling, playing tennis, skiing, and golfing), making art (watercolor, ink drawings, print making, photography and when I have access to a studio, making pottery; check out my art on Instagram, [@kjsketch](https://www.instagram.com/kjsketch/)), and eating (... and cooking but I'm a better sous chef and taste tester).
